Design files for qUarkNano CANBUS UC4H Flight controller.

No PWM outputs, canbus only. Please see Olliw http://www.olliw.eu/2017/uavcan-for-hobbyists/

3 Uarts, 1 RCIN & a Two pin power port, this design is untested at the moment... you have been warned..

This flight controller is to be used with either Betacopter or Ardupilot using nodes from Oliiw designs.
